# Doctor Photos

## How to Add Doctor Photos:

1. Save doctor photos in this folder
2. Name them exactly as referenced in the database:
   - `dr_shalini.jpg` - Dr. Shalini Duvvada
   - `dr_karthik.jpg` - Dr. Karthik Paidi

3. Recommended image specifications:
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Size: 400x500 pixels (portrait)
   - File size: < 500KB
   - Professional medical attire
   - Clean background

## Current Photos:

The system is currently using placeholder URLs. To use local photos:

1. Place your photos in this folder
2. Update the database photo_url to: `/images/dr_name.jpg`
3. Or run the seed script with updated paths

## Fallback:

If a photo fails to load, the system automatically shows a placeholder image.
